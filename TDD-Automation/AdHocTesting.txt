Ad-Hoc Testing (AT): 
   Testing the application randomly without referring to the requirements is k.a., AT.
   
It is -ve testing. Here we dont refer to requirements. We just randomly perform the testing.

It is also k.a., Random Testing, Monkey Testing OR Gorilla Testing


Q: When to do AT?
Ans: AT is not a mandatory Testing. But it is recommended. Hence it should be done after completion of all the testings provided If you have a time.


Q: Does Test cases are required for AT?
Ans: No.


Q: Why ad-hoc Testing is required?
Ans: Customer can encounter the issues when they use the s/w randomly. We don't want our customer to face the issues when they use the s/w randomly. Hence we act as customer OR end user & perform AT.


Note: Most of the ad-Hoc defects are invalid. It will we considered valid only when the issue is having impact on the business.


Q: What QA has to do If they find blocker OR critical defects during AT?
Ans:  
  (a) QA should log the blocker defects immediately against the dev.
  (b) QA must document the defect (Write the Test case). So that the same idea will be executed over all the builds.
